# Formatted Licenses

**Disclaimer: @frewsxcv is not a laywer**

This repository contains various software licenses formatted as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Licenses

* Mozilla
 * [MPL, version 2]() [WIP]

## Why did you do this?

Licenses are not just files that take up space in the root directory of a project. They are meant to be **read** and **understood** by humans (not computers). Because some licenses can be fairly lengthy, it can get tiring to stare at a wall of fixed-width characters. formatted-licenses is an attempt to increase the user experience of reading licenses by adding formatting and other helpful markup.

## You're missing license

Don't see your favorite license in this repository? [Open an Issue](https://github.com/frewsxcv/formatted-licenses/issues/new) and I'll get right on it.

## Other formats

If you want these licenses formatted in a format other than Markdown, I recommend using a document conversion tool like [pandoc](http://pandoc.org).

## Guidelines

TODO: Mention why plaintext files are in the tree (for diff purposes)

* Don't wrap lines
