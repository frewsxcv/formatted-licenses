# Formatted Licenses

This repository contains various software licenses formatted as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). All licenses can be found in their respective folders within the `licenses/` top level directory.

## You're missing license

Don't see your favorite license in this repository? [Open an Issue](https://github.com/frewsxcv/formatted-licenses/issues/new) and I'll get right on it.

## Other formats

If you want these licenses formatted in a format other than Markdown, I recommend using a document conversion tool like [pandoc](http://pandoc.org).
